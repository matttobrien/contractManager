> Contract Manager

## Architecture

``` bash
The main files are in the src folder.
Routes.js contains all of the get/post resquests and what controller each one is directed to.
App.js conatins the basic Express.js set up.
The Controllers contain the functions that send data(mostly from the DB) to the Front-End.
```

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8081
npm start
```
